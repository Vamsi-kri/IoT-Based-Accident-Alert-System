# IoT-Based-Accident-Alert-System
With road safety being a critical global concern, this project aims to reduce emergency response times and minimize accident impact through automated alerting. The system detects sudden deceleration or rollover using the MPU6050 sensor, determines the exact location via GPS, and sends alerts using IFTTT automation.
